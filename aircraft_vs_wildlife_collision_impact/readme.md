### Business Problem
#### - To understand what factors influence the level of damage given a case of collision between wildlife and an aircraft
#### - To throw light on the cost of repair borne by the US Civil Aviation Industry when such collisions happen 

## EDA Findings
#### - The relationship between the number of strikes and the cost incurred is somewhat directly propotional
#### - Cases of strikes are significantly high when struck by small birds as compared to medium and large sized birds
#### - Most of the strikes happen during the approach phase of flight in a distance less than 40 Nautical miles from the airport
#### - Flights have more cases of collisions during the day and night times as compared to dusk and dawn
#### - Damages requiring Major Repairs or Replacement of Parts count for almost 72.5% of the cost that is incurred by the US Civil Aviation Industry
#### - The highest number of strikes is reported between the months of July and October followed by a peak in the month of May for every year.
#### - There is a sharp dip in the number of cases reported in 2020, possibly due to lesser number of flights running during the pandemic.
#### - The number of reported cases has been almost persistently increasing over the years
